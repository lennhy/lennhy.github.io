Sometimes I find myself in a bind with the code I am writting. Either it is not giving me the result I expect or it has a bug that I can't seem to fix right away, and It can be tempting to ask someone with more experience for help. But as you will see this may not be the best solution. 

The problem with this is that if everytime you have a problem you go to someone for help, you don't give yourself the chance to mature. But by becoming dependent on someone else to debug your code you won't ever learn how to be independent and solve your own problems when there is no one around to help you. Instead try to figure out the problem  on your own first and if you still can't solve it ask for help from someone with experience.

I've found that even after many unsuccesful attempts of trying to fix a bug, I learn a lot of invaluable knowledge along the way. Knowledge that I would not have known otherwise if I were to have ask for help right away! 

Call it* Compound learning* !  

Although it is always benificial to pair program with another programmer who can help you debug your code. Pairing should'nt only be a means to an end. Instead it should be a way for programmers to learn from each other and help write better code. 

If you are stuck on a problem you will mature faster if you first try to figure out the problem on your own first! In many ways it's a life lesson as it can be applied to other disciplines in life, like school, sports, martial arts....
