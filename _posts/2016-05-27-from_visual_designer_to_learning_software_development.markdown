It is challenging and empowering to be able to create something from nothing. In the begining there was darkness then there was light. Similarly, before technology developed to what it is today man was in a kind of darkness limited by his own ability to innovate. That is where I was before I discovered programming. As a designer I was limited to creating art and design to communicate and make sense of the world. With programming I can go beyond that and create tools that people can use and interact with, tools that have a practical and less abstract nature. This allows me to break out of the visual and abstract world of design and art and traverse the complexities of engineering and innovate tools for our generation.
