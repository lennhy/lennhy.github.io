It is challenging and empowering to be able to create something from nothing. In the begging there was darkness then there was light. Similarly, before technology developed to what it is today man was in a kind of darkness limited by his ability to innovate. That is where I was before I discovered programming. As a designer I was limited to creating art aesthetics to communicate and make sense to the world. With programming I can go beyond that and create tools that people can use and interact with, tools that have a practical and less abstract nature. This allows me to break out of the visual and abstract world of design and art and traverse the complexities of engineering innovative tools for our generation. It's exciting!
